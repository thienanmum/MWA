1. SetImmediate is used to schedule the execution of a callback after all IO callbacks executed. For the IO callbacks, 
we don't know how long the execution lasts. Therefore, using SetImmediate is more efficient than using setTimeout 
for do some processing right after IO operations finished.

2. Difference between process.nextTick and SetImmediate is:
- process.nextTick: schedules a callback to be executed right after the current operation completes.
That means the callback will be executed before any additional IO or timer events. The callback is put into the nextTick queue. 
- SetImmediate: schedule a callback to be executed after all IO event callbacks finished. The callback is put in the check phase queue.
